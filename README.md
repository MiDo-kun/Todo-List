# Todo List

The Todo List is a web application that allows users to add tasks to a list and manage them. The application is built using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The live website can be accessed here.

The Todo List is designed to help users keep track of their tasks and manage their time more effectively. Users can add tasks to the list, mark them as completed, and delete them when they are no longer needed. The application uses local storage to store the task data, so users can access their tasks even after closing and reopening the application.
